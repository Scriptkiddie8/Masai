Develop a React component that enables users to upload files using the Fetch API. The component should include a file input for selecting files, and upon submission, it sends a POST request to a designated endpoint with the chosen file attached in a FormData object. Implement appropriate error handling and feedback for successful or unsuccessful file uploads, providing a seamless user experience.
