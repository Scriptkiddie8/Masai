Develop a React component for user authentication utilizing the Fetch API with an email-based login. The component should manage user input for email and password, send a POST request to the specified authentication API endpoint (https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/login), handle authentication tokens, and display appropriate messages based on the authentication status. Ensure the component provides a seamless user experience for logging in and displays an authentication token upon successful login.

Use following credentials for login:
{
"email":"bruce@wayne.com",
"password":"gotham123"
}'
