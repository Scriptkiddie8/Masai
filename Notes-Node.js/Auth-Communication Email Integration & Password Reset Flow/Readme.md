✅ Learning Objectives
Understand why security is crucial in backend development
Learn how to protect passwords using hashing
Implement secure login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
🌐 1. Security Measures & Backend Responsibility
🔎 1.1 Why Backend Security Is Essential
Backends handle sensitive user data: passwords, emails, transactions, etc.

It’s the backend’s responsibility to ensure this data is secure.

Without proper security, systems are vulnerable to:

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
🛡️ 1.2 Types of Security Measures
Security in Backend

Authentication: Who are you? (e.g., login)
Authorization: Are you allowed to do this?
Password Hashing: Hide real passwords using algorithms
Encryption: Protect data during transfer (e.g., HTTPS)
Input Validation: Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks
Rate Limiting: Prevent brute-force login attempts
Session/JWT Management: Manage user sessions securely
🔁 1.3 Hashing vs. Encryption
Feature Hashing Encryption
Direction One-way (irreversible) Two-way (reversible)
Use Case Password protection Secure data transfer/storage
Can be undone? ❌ No ✅ Yes (with a key)
Example: Hashing mySecret123 with bcrypt → $2b$10$N... (cannot be reversed)

🔑 2. Password Hashing & Comparison
🤔 2.1 Why Not Store Raw Passwords?
Storing raw passwords is extremely risky.
If your database leaks, every user’s credentials are exposed.
Solution: Hash passwords before saving to the database.
🧂 2.2 Hashing Passwords with bcrypt
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");

async function hashPassword(password) {
const saltRounds = 10;
return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
}
Salt makes the hash unique—even if two users use the same password.
Slows down brute-force attacks.
🔁 2.3 Comparing Passwords During Login
async function comparePasswords(plainPassword, hashedPassword) {
return await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword);
}
Compares the entered password with the stored hash securely.
🛂 3. Token-Based Authentication with JWT
❓ 3.1 Is Hashing Alone Enough?
Hashing protects passwords, but doesn’t help with access management.
Once a user logs in, we need a way to allow access to protected routes without re-checking passwords constantly.
🧾 3.2 Why Use JWT?
After login, server sends back a JWT token.
This token proves the user is authenticated.
The user sends this token with each request to access protected routes.
JWT = JSON Web Token Contains user data (e.g., ID, role) and is signed with a secret key.

🛠️ 3.3 Creating a JWT
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

function generateToken(userData) {
return jwt.sign(userData, "your_secret_key", { expiresIn: "1h" });
}
Token includes expiry (e.g., 1 hour).
Payload might look like: { id: "abc123", role: "admin" }
🛡️ 3.4 Verifying JWT on Protected Routes
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];

if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: "No token" });

try {
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, "your_secret_key");
req.user = decoded;
next();
} catch (err) {
res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
}
}
This middleware checks if the token is valid before giving access to protected resources.
⚠️ Common Pitfalls
1️⃣ Security is a backend responsibility
Never assume frontend validation is enough.
Always sanitize, validate, and secure data on the backend.
2️⃣ Hashing ≠ Encryption
Hashing is one-way and used for passwords.
Don’t confuse it with encryption (e.g., HTTPS).
3️⃣ Hashing and JWT are not alternatives
Hashing protects the password.
JWT manages user sessions after authentication.
🧠 Summary
Concept Purpose
Hashing Store passwords securely
bcrypt Node.js library for hashing
JWT Manage user sessions post-login
Token middleware Check if user is allowed to access
